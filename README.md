## What is Overherd?

Overherd is a mobile application that allows its users to anonymously post text with a desired "loudness". 

**Loudness** determines the geographic distance a post is visible. For example, a post with a loudness of 1 mile will allow all users within a mile of the post at the time of posting to see the post.
